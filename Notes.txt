Notes!

sinh and cosh equations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function
sinh(x) = (1 - exp(-2x))/ 2*exp(-x)
cosh(x) = (1 + exp(-2x))/ 2*exp(-x)

Exponential overview (adapted from https://www.quinapalus.com/efunc.html)
tl;dr we need to break down an exponential into "easy to multiply" format

y = exp(x) => y = exp(x) * exp(-x) = 1. From here, we can break down -x into 2 numbers: one of which being easy to multiply
(product of 2).
From here, a lookup table is used to multiply y by the easy number and subtract the remaining value from the x.

i.e. say x = 4, y = 1 (NOTE I think y is always 1??)
let k be a number such that exp(k) is "easy to multiply"

From here we look for the biggest k value to subtract from x (found in lookup table).
Then we multiply y by exp(k).

Rinse and repeat until x < smallest k value. Note that a bigger lookup table results in more accuracy.
