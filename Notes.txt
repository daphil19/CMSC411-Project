Notes!

sinh and cosh equations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function
sinh(x) = (1 - exp(-2x))/ 2*exp(-x)
cosh(x) = (1 + exp(-2x))/ 2*exp(-x)

Exponential overview (adapted from https://www.quinapalus.com/efunc.html)
tl;dr we need to break down an exponential (e^x) into "easy to multiply" (e^a * e^b) format

start with x value and y = 1. From here, we find the biggest power of 2 whose natural log is less than or equal to x.
Multiply (really bit shift) y by power of 2 and subtract natural log of value from x.
Rinse and repeat until we reach finest grain or 0

Development and testing shall be done using Xilinx software.

----Hierarchy Overview----
There shall be 3 main modules at the top-level hierarchy:
1. Memory (or registers) for the respective lookup tables
2. Memory (or registers) for the input and output
3. The CORDIC calculation module

The CORDIC module shall contain a bit shifter, subtractor, registers to hold output and intermediary values, and multiplexed signal logic.
